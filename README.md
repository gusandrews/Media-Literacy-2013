Media-Literacy
==============

Syllabus for a media literacy course to be taught at Marist College in 2012-2013.
This was going to be a fork from <a href="https://github.com/gusandrews/adelphi-ed-tech-courses">the Digital Literacies course</a> I was working on with Matt Curinga -- and if you look at contemporary commits you should see they has a similar flavr -- but given that this course is for undergrads and that one is for masters-level educators-in-training, the literature was not really comparable and I had to start over. 

As I write this syllabus, we seem to be in the early days of educators tracking the origins of their syllabi using tools like GitHub. Curriculum-writers in this era will be hard-pressed to trace the origins of their syllabi, as their own professors may have posted their syllabi to proprietary, ephemeral, and idiosyncratic courseware, handed them out as photocopied sheets in class, or perhaps even written them on typewriters.

I want to make an effort, then, to point back to the roots of this syllabus. It is "forked" from, among other syllabi, Frank Moretti's History of Communications class (2003) and John Broughton's Media and Visual Culture class (2005) at Teachers College; Rasmus Kleis Nielsen's stellar first-time-teaching course at Columbia Universty's Journalism School (2008); David Kerr's Investigative Journalism class at Hampshire College (1997); and, in the spirit of critiquing academic research, Ray Coppinger's Animal Behavior class at Hampshire (1995 -- because yes, first-year undergrads can be thrown into the deep end of reading original research and learn from it -- or even, in my case, be profoundly changed by it). And, if I'm doing this right, Lalitha Vasudevan's pedagogy, generally. (There will be Post-Its.) This syllabus also owes debts of gratitude for inspiration to Danielle Kaplan, Renee Hobbs, Matt Curinga, Chuck Kinzer, my Poly teachers Zeva Lahorgue and Roger Ipswitch, the staff of the Media Education Foundation, everyone involved with the HOPE conference, and the MetaFilter community (for schooling me on Charlie Brooker).

===================

Forked from the syllabus I'm working off of in 2012, to remind myself how I want to run this next semester.
